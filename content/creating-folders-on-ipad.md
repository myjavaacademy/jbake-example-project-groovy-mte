Hi All!

A week before I received my iPad2 and believe me it amazing. It has so many features. My iPad exploration is still continue.

While going through the ways to arrange my home screen, i found this cool feature about creating the folders on your home screens.

Follow the below steps to create the folders &#8211;
  
1. Tap and hold on any app icon until it starts to jiggle and you see cross icons on apps.
  
2. Now tap and hold on any one icon and drag it over the other app icon you wish to group with. This will automatically create a folder with the two apps in it. Now you can move other apps also in this folder. 

Remember one folder can hold at max 20 items.

The best part of this is, it understands the apps you are dragging on each other first time for creating folder and names the folder accordingly. Eg. If I drag Facebook app onto skype, it creates a folder and renames it &#8216;social&#8217; which sounds very logical. If I drag times of India app on ndtv India news app, it creates a folder with name &#8216;news&#8217;. You can obviously rename the folders. Tap on folder you wish to rename and do it.

This is applicable to iPhone too.

Enjoy!!!
